## AML Modeling. Academic tools for AutomationML and CAEX built on top of Model-Driven Engineering techniques and practices ðŸ‘‹

This project offers a comprehensive suite of academic solutions for modeling with AutomationML and CAEX. 
The toolset features a CAEX modeling workbench built on Eclipse EMF and Sirius, along with various model transformations 
for importing and exporting models (e.g., .caex) to meet the requirements of different organizational partners in national and European projects.
